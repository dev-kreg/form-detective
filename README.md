# FormDetective

FormDetective is a web-based simulated desktop environment built with Angular. It features movable, resizable applet windows (such as a calendar and web browser), a taskbar, and a retro terminal-inspired UI. The project demonstrates a "homemade" windowing system and UI componentsâ€”no third-party component libraries are used for the desktop or applets.

## Technology
